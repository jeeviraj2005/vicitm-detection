This project focuses on detecting human victims trapped under debris in disaster scenarios. Using YOLO (You Only Look Once), an efficient real-time object detection model, we aim to identify victims accurately to aid in emergency response operations.

The model is trained on the C2A Dataset, which contains images representing various disaster scenarios with victims under debris.
